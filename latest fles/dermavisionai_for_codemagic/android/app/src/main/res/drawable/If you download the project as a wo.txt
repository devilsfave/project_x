If you download the project as a workspace in a .tar file, you may still need to install dependencies. Here's why:

1. Node modules: The .tar file might not include the `node_modules` directory, which contains all the project dependencies. This directory is often excluded from version control and compressed files to reduce size.

2. Environment-specific builds: Even if `node_modules` is included, some packages might need to be rebuilt for your specific environment.

3. Ensuring consistency: Installing dependencies ensures you have the exact versions specified in the project's `package.json` file.

4. Platform-specific files: Some dependencies might require platform-specific files that need to be generated on your machine.

Here's what you should do:

1. Extract the .tar file.

2. Open a terminal/command prompt in the extracted project directory.

3. Run the following command to install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   or if you're using Yarn:
   ```
   yarn install
   ```

4. After installation, you might need to run additional setup commands specific to React Native, such as:
   ```
   npx react-native link
   ```

5. If you're using Expo, you might need to run:
   ```
   expo install
   ```

Even if the `node_modules` directory is present, running these commands ensures your project is properly set up for your specific environment. It's a good practice to do this whenever you clone or download a project to a new machine or environment.

Remember, you'll still need to set up your development environment (Node.js, React Native CLI, Android Studio, etc.) as outlined in the previous responses.
